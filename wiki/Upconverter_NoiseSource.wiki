#summary How to use the Noise Source Circuit on the Upconverter

The Noise Source is a basic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown Avalanche] [http://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN3469.pdf noise circuit].  A 5V to 12V [http://www.semtech.com/power-management/switching-regulators/sc4503/ boost regulator] is used to power a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode#Uses Zener] diode which use Avalanche breakdown above 6V.  The output is DC-blocked and amplified by about 40dB using two amplifiers.

The Noise Source is not fully populated on production boards.  To use it you will need to purchase and populate two SOT-89 amplifier ICs (such as [http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MMG3H21NT1/MMG3H21NT1CT-ND MMG3H21NT1]), the Boost Regulator ([http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/SC4503TSKTRT/SC4503TSKCT-ND SC4503TSKTRT]), an SMA Connector (such as [http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CONSMA003.062/CONSMA003.062-ND CONSMA003.062]), a 2-pin 0.1" header (such as [http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/961102-6404-AR/3M9447-ND 961102-6404-AR]) and a 0.1" jumper (such as [http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/969102-0000-DA/3M9580-ND 969102-0000-DA]).

These parts were omitted to reduce costs since a Noise Source isn't used in an Upconverter.  If you use a different amplifier than the MMG3H21NT1 you may need to [http://www.digikey.com/scripts/dksearch/dksus.dll?k=RC1206JR&vendor=0&mnonly=0&newproducts=0&ptm=0&fid=0&quantity=0&PV3=2&PV7=2&stock=1 adjust the value] of `R12` which is 1R0 (1.0 Ohm).  Refer to your amplifier's datasheet.  The amplifier supply voltage is 5V from the USB connector.

== Usage ==

When using the Noise Source, place the Upconverter into Passthrough Mode (switch away from SMA connector) and install the `Noise_Source_EN` power jumper prior to powering the Upconverter board through the USB connector.  Otherwise the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce contact bounce] will create problems.
