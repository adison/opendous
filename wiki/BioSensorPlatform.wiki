#summary ADS1298 Based Biopotential Sensor Platform

*Status*: _Under Development_.  Fourth revision is under development.  The pictured third revision did not work correctly and the earlier [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/ADS1298/ second revision] was a BGA-based design.

[http://www.opendous.org Opendous Inc.] is currently developing an OpenHardware [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopotential Biopotential] Sensor Platform based on [http://www.ti.com/ TI]'s [http://www.ti.com/product/ads1299 ADS1299] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADC ADC] with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography EEG] front end for use in a head-mounted 32+ non-contact electrode system.

Design files are available in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format Open Formats] for the [http://iut-tice.ujf-grenoble.fr/kicad/ KiCAD] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation EDA] Suite.

==Design==

The design uses powered electrodes connected with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA SATA] shielded cables to reduce noise and provide low output impedance signals to the ADS1298.  SATA cables are a cheap way to connect a differential signal pair, bipolar power supply, and ground through a shielded, controlled impedance and controlled capacitance commodity cable that is flexible and comes in lengths from 30cm to 1.5m.  Also, SATA cables have [http://www.heilind.com/products/hitachi/sata_cat.pdf lower capacitance] than similarly sized [http://rfcafe.com/references/electrical/coax-chart.htm coaxial cables] and only slightly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire#Solid_versus_stranded higher resistance].  The [http://code.google.com/p/opennect/wiki/Opennect_ADC Opennect-ADC-Differential] connector pinout is used.

===Non-Contact Capacitive Electrode Example using !OpAmp===

During exploration of non-contact electrodes the [http://sites.google.com/site/openloopproject/ OpenLoop] project pointed me towards [http://www.isn.ucsd.edu/pubs/wh2010.pdf this article].  Based on those ideas the following amplified opamp-based electrode was designed:

===Non-Contact Capacitive Electrode Example using !InAmp===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out The better the data the better the results] so exploration of classic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_amplifier instrumentation amplifier] electrodes is ongoing.

===Non-Contact Capacitive Electrode Leg Driver===

To improve common-mode interference a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driven_right_leg_circuit right leg driver] circuit is required although for EEG this is usually placed on the neck.

===Non-Contact Capacitive Electrode===

A direct connection to the ADC is also useful.
