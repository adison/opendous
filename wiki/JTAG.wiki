#summary FT2232H JTAG Debugger for OpenOCD
#labels Phase-Deploy

This is a DIY project with design files available in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/FT2232H_JTAG_Adapter SVN].  The design is 8mil/8mil trace/space with minimum 20mil vias for cheap PCB prototyping.

This current revision requires a custom version of [http://openocd.berlios.de/web/ OpenOCD].  The next revision will use a more common OpenOCD JTAG layout.  This board is still useful if you only need the JTAG pins (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO) or the secondary bus.
