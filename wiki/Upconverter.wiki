#summary MF/HF to 100MHz Upconverter

PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Converts signals in the 0.1MHz to 60MHz range to signals in the 100.1MHz to 160MHz range.  Intended for use in receiver applications with projects like [http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr RTL-SDR] or the [http://www.funcubedongle.com/ FunCube Dongle], or to listen to AM radio using an FM receiver.

The design files can be found in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Upconverter/ SVN].  The board was designed using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software Free Open-Source Software] [http://iut-tice.ujf-grenoble.fr/kicad/ KiCad] and [http://qucs.sourceforge.net/ QUCS].

= Design =

The Upconverter is a passive [http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/mixers/double-balanced-mixer-tutorial.php Double-Balanced Mixer] with RF switches at input and output to allow a passthrough mode.  Power is sourced from a standard USB-microB connector.

RF and IF ports in a Double-Balanced Mixer are interchangeable but there is more LO-to-RF Isolation than LO-to-IF Isolation.  To reduce LO radiation through the antenna, the RF port is used as input and the RF Low-pass filter has greater than 60dB attenuation at the LO frequency.

The mixer used is the [http://www.minicircuits.com/homepage/homepage.html Mini-Circuits] [www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/ADE-1.pdf ADE-1] with +7dBm LO Power Level to reduce noise.

== RF Input Low-pass Filter ==

The input [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter Low-pass filter] is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_filter Elliptic (Cauer)] filter used for its sharp transition between passband and stopband.  This allows a further reduction in LO radiation through the antenna and keeps higher frequencies from mixing with the intended output products.

The filter was designed to have less than 1dB of ripple in its passband and a 3dB cutoff at the lower input range of cheap SDR dongles (64MHz).

== LO Band-pass Filter ==

Most oscillators show significant bleed of the internal frequency used in their multiplier circuitry.  With 100MHz oscillators the internal frequency tends to be in the 20-25MHz range, directly in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency HF] band of interest.  To reduce these frequencies at the output and also help reduce LO harmonics, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_filter Bessel] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandpass band-pass] filter is used for its minimal phase distortion to keep the LO signal as clean as possible.

The attenuator and filter are used to reduce the LO level to the required +7dBm.

= SDR Software Tuning Instructions =

Tune to 100.01MHz and see where the nearest peak is (other than 100MHz).  This is the ideal base tuning frequency for your combination of Upconverter and Receiver.
