#summary LPC313x DIP Development Board

This project has been abandoned.  These designs are not viable commercially at lower quantities.  The LPC313x is great value in volume production but that does not extend well to prototype lots.

The LPC313x-DIY is a very limited 2-layer single-sided components board made to 8mil-8mil-20mil (trace-clearance-minimum_drill) specification with PCBs available at cost from [http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/44279 BatchPCB].  All design files are [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Abandoned_Designs/LPC313x-DIY/ available] in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/checkout SVN].

There is also a DIP version but the USB will not work at High Speed due to noise from other signals.  It is very difficult to properly route such a board using just 2-layers.  Adding internal GND planes would probably be enough to make it usable.
