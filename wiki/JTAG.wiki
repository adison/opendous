This is a DIY project with design files available in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG SVN].  The design is 8mil/8mil trace/clearnace with minimum 20mil vias for cheap PCB fabrication.  PCBs of this design can be purchased at cost through [http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/44280 BatchPCB].  The smallest component is 0805 to ease prototyping.  A manufacturing tutorial will be posted at some point in the future.

It has Cortex Debug, ARM, and Xilinx JTAG headers.  The associated required cables are: [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=SAM8218-ND 0.05" 5x2 for Cortex Debug], [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=H3AAH-2006G-ND 0.1" 10x2 for ARM], and [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=122-1476-ND 2mm 7x4 for Xilinx].

You can play with this design yourself as it is an [OpenHardware] board and [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG all design materials] are [http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution Licensed] and made with the Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD EDA Suite].

The Opendous FT2232H JTAG uses Channel B for JTAG as only Channel A supports fast synchronous 245 mode which will be used for other functionality later on.  If using the [http://openocd.sourceforge.net/ OpenOCD] [http://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/openocd/0.5.0/ 0.5.0 release]
you will need to alter line `2216` of [http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=blob;f=src/jtag/drivers/ft2232.c ft2232.c] from
{{{
	/* default to INTERFACE_A */
	if(channel == INTERFACE_ANY) { channel = INTERFACE_A; }
}}}
to
{{{
	/* default to INTERFACE_B */
	if(channel == INTERFACE_ANY) { channel = INTERFACE_B; }
}}}
in order to use Channel B for JTAG.  Recompile OpenOCD and install this modified version under a different name.  The board will then function as a JTAGKey with the default FTDI VID and PID:
{{{
ft2232_device_desc "Dual RS232-HS"
ft2232_layout jtagkey
ft2232_vid_pid 0x0403 0x6010
}}}

Unfortunately channel selection is still not implemented via configuration scripts.

See the [http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/ libftdi] Project for Open Source software to control this board.
