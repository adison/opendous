#summary Simple DIY'able Development Board for the LPC313x ARM9 Microcontroller

This board has been prototyped but is not very useful.

The LPC313x-DIY has limited functionality as it is a 2-layer single-sided components board made to 8mil-8mil-20mil (trace-clearance-minimum_drill) specification.  It is surprising how much functionality managed to be routed.
