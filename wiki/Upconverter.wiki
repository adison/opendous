#summary MF/HF Converter for Receivers
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

Converts signals in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_frequency MF] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency HF] Bands (0.5MHz to 50MHz) to signals in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency VHF] Band (125.5MHz to 175MHz) for the 125MHz version.  Intended for use in receiver applications with projects like [http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr RTL-SDR]/[http://sdrsharp.com/ SDR#] or [http://www.funcubedongle.com/ FunCube Dongle].

The board was designed using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software Free and Open-Source Software] [http://iut-tice.ujf-grenoble.fr/kicad/ KiCad] and [http://qucs.sourceforge.net/ QUCS].

There are two versions of this Upconverter that differ in the LO and IF/Output filters, a [#100MHz_Upconverter 100MHz version] and a [#125MHz_Upconverter 125MHz version] version.

== 125MHz Upconverter Upconversion Losses ==

The 125MHz Upconverter has Upconversion Losses ([http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Upconverter/Upconverter-125MHz_2560pts_50ms_Upconversion_Losses.s1p data]) of approximately 10dB from 0.1MHz to 55.8MHz and 15dB from 45kHz to 64.5MHz ([http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Upconverter/Upconverter-125MHz_0.001-1MHz_2560pts_50ms_Upconversion_Losses.s1p data]).  The [http://www.minicircuits.com/app/AN00-009.pdf 1dB compression point] is at +1dBm (this is the maximum input signal level before distortion occurs).

= SDR Software Tuning Instructions =

With your Upconverter input shorted or unconnected, tune your SDR software to several kHz above the Upconversion frequency (100.06MHz or 125.06MHz depending on version).  Note where the nearest peak is (other than 100.06MHz/125.06MHz where you will see the DC spike) in the FFT display.  This value takes into account any frequency offset from the Receiver/Demodulator.  Since the 25ppm 100MHz oscillator is likely more precise than the Receiver/Demodulator, subtract the Upconversion frequency from the value to get the Receiver/Demodulator offset (in the picture below it would be 100.0045-100=0.0045).  To tune to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_bands Shortwave band] such as 9.5MHz, simply add 9.5 to 100 and subtract the offset (9.5 + 100 - 0.0045 = 109.4955).  With a high enough SDR sampling speed (0.5MSPS+) you will now be able to make out communication signals you can further tune to.

= FAQ =

* It doesn't work! * : Please first check all connections and try different cables.  Then try a different USB power source (different port on PC, no hub).  Then put the Upconverter into Upconvert mode and connect to your receiver tuned to 125.01MHz to see the LO bleed.  You should be able to receive the 125MHz LO signal from the mixer which is about -45dBm at the IF/OUTput port.

* I cannot receive any signals * : If the above doesn't help, try a better/larger antenna.  A quick hack is to connect the Upconverter INput to a large piece of safe exposed household metal such as a metal sink and its pipes or radiator. I recommend avoiding use of RF equipment during lightning storms or when lightning is forecast.  You should be able to receive AM radio stations (0.5-2MHz) by tuning your receiver to 125.5-127MHz when connected to the Upconverter in Upconvert mode.

* Can I connect two receivers to the same Upconverter? * : Yes, but the two receivers must have inputs that are compatible with each other.  The safest option is to make sure both receivers have no DC feed through a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_tee bias tee] or disable this option.  The receivers could damage each other if one or both have a DC bias.  The output of the Upconverter is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_block DC-Blocked] so you do not need to worry about it unless dealing with high power levels (> +10dBm). Check out the [Upconverter_Splitter Upconverter Splitter] page.

* Why not add an amplifier to overcome the 10dB conversion loss? * : Since the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_figure Noise Figure] of an RF system is most dependent on the Noise Figure of the first elements in the signal chain, it does make sense to place an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_noise_amplifier LNA] at the antenna port.  I just wasn't sure if most users would have their Upconverter at their antenna.

* Can it be used for Transmitting? * : Sure, there are no one-way paths in the Upconverter.  If you have a VHF transmitter that operates in the 100MHz to 150MHz range then the Upconverter can be used in reverse as a down-converting mixer to broadcast over 0.5MHz to 50MHz (downconverted 100.5MHz to 150MHz signal).  All you would need is a Power Amplifier and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandpass bandpass filter] for your intended frequency range at the RF port and an attenuator at the IF port if the transmitting signal was above 0dBm.
