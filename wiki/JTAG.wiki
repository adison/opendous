This is a DIY project with design files available in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG SVN].  The design is 8mil/8mil trace/clearnace with minimum 20mil vias for cheap PCB fabrication.  PCBs of this design can be purchased at cost through [http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/44068 BatchPCB].  The smallest component is 0805 to ease prototyping.  A manufacturing tutorial will be posted at some point in the future.

It has Cortex Debug, ARM, and Xilinx JTAG headers.  The associated required cables are: [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=SAM8218-ND 0.05" 5x2 for Cortex Debug], [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=H3AAH-2006G-ND 0.1" 10x2 for ARM], and [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=122-1476-ND 2mm 7x4 for Xilinx].

You can play with this design yourself as it is an [OpenHardware] board and [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG all design materials] are [http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution Licensed] and made with the Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD EDA Suite].

The Opendous FT2232H JTAG uses Channel B for JTAG as only Channel A supports fast synchronous 245 mode which will be used for other functionality later on.  If using the [http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=snapshot;h=56e74908d17d740db0a376f354c21e6608e8af8d;sf=tgz 0.4.0 release]
you will need to alter line `2016` of [http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=blob_plain;f=src/jtag/drivers/ft2232.c;hb=56e74908d17d740db0a376f354c21e6608e8af8d ft2232.c] from
{{{
         if (ftdi_set_interface(&ftdic, INTERFACE_A) < 0)
}}}
to
{{{
         if (ftdi_set_interface(&ftdic, INTERFACE_B) < 0)
}}}
in order to use Channel B for JTAG.  The next release of [http://openocd.berlios.de/web/ OpenOCD] will feature the ability to change this setting more easily.
