#summary LPC175x DIP Development Board

Designed to interface electronics to PCs via the Full Speed USB or 10/100 Ethernet interfaces.

Design Files are available in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/LPC175x-DIP-Board SVN].

* Status * : 2009-11-18 - Board development is currently on hold in favor of the Opendous LPC176x Development Board.  The LPC176x Board is a 2-layer 8mil/8mil design with 20mil vias and uses 0805 components to allow cheap prototyping.  All design materials created thus far are in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/LPC176x-Development-Board SVN].
