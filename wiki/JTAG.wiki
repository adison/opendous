This is a DIY project with design files available in [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG SVN].  The design is 8mil/8mil trace/space with minimum 20mil vias for cheap PCB prototyping.

It has Cortex Debug, ARM, and Xilinx JTAG headers.  The associated required cables are: [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=SAM8218-ND 0.05" 5x2 for Cortex Debug], [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=H3AAH-2006G-ND 0.1" 10x2 for ARM], and [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=122-1476-ND 2mm 7x4 for Xilinx].

You can play with this design yourself as it is an [OpenHardware] board and [http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Opendous_FT2232H_JTAG all design materials] are [http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution Licensed] and made with the Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD EDA Suite].
