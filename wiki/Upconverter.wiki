== 125MHz Upconverter Upconversion Losses ==

The 125MHz Upconverter has Upconversion Losses ([http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Upconverter/Upconverter-125MHz_2560pts_50ms_Upconversion_Losses.s1p data]) of approximately 10dB from 0.1MHz to 55.8MHz and 15dB from 45kHz to 64.5MHz ([http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/Upconverter/Upconverter-125MHz_0.001-1MHz_2560pts_50ms_Upconversion_Losses.s1p data]).  The [http://www.minicircuits.com/app/AN00-009.pdf 1dB compression point] is at +1dBm (this is the maximum input signal level before distortion occurs).
